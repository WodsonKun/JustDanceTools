# FNT2TFN Converter
A tool made to convert **BMFont's XML FNT** format onto **UbiArt JSON TFN** format, in order to use custom fonts inside of **Just Dance** games.

## Requirements
- Python 3+

## How to use
- First, convert your font (.ttf/.otf) using [BBFont](https://www.angelcode.com/products/bmfont/)
> Note: Don't forget to set it up through ***"Font Settings"*** and ***"Export Settings"***... Feel free to use one of my templates inside of the ***"templates"*** folder
> Don't forget to set the export format to ***XML***
- Then, export it with whatever name you want and run ``fnt2tfn.py``
- Select the FNT you just exported with BBFont
- Tada, your TFN should be inside of the "output" folder
- Check for any conflicting characters... If it doesn't have any, you're good to go!
