# Kanji2Romaji
A tool made to convert Just Dance Wii U and Just Dance Yo-Kai: Special Edition's Kanji KTAPEs onto Romaji ones

## Requirements
- Python 3+

You also need pyKakasi and Unidecode in order to be able to run this tool
> `pip install pykakasi`

> `pip install unidecode`

## Instructions
Run the `justdancejapan_romajiconverter.py` file and wait for it to initialize
After a few moments, a window will pop-up, asking for the KTAPE file
Select the desired KTAPE file and after that, check the `output` folder

 **Note: The KTAPE file needs to be decrypted first, before using this tool, as both Just Dance Wii U and Yo-kai: Special Edition use Just Dance 2014 as basis, so it means, encrypted `timeline.tpl.ckd` files**
