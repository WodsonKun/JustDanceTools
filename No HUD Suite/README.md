# No HUD Suite
Tool that converts usual video formats (with or without audio) to **Just Dance 2017** (PC) or **Just Dance 2016, Just Dance 2017, Just Dance 2018 and Just Dance 2019** (Wii U)

## Instructions
- Open `NoHUDTool.exe`
The interface is simple to use, just click on what you want it to do and press "Convert"

**Note: As I wrote the tool for personal use, I wrote the whole UI in Portuguese (Brazilian) instead of English, so if you have any issue understanding, use Google Translate until I update the tool**

### Little trick...
Rename a audio file's extension to `.avi` and put it on the tool

The tool will generate a WAV.CKD from that .avi

## Requirements
- Python 3+
- DirectPlay (Windows add-on)
