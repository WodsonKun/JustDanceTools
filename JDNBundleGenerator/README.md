# Welcome!

This tool currently works for Just Dance 2017 PC only. There are some bugs here and there, maybe stuff that needs to be updated and etc, but it's usable for the moment.

The picto utility only works with Solo songs for now so your pictos might be broken with duets, trios or quatros. (It's going to be updated, don't worry)
