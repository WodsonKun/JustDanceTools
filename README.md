# Woody's Just Dance Tools
Public repository created to store my custom-made tools for Just Dance (UbiArt Engine)

## Development and updates
Almost all of the tools were developed by me during boredom on work or something like that

Other tools, like the PictoCooker were adapted from other people's tools (of course, public tools)

I want to update every single tool to become easier to use, and also more efficient, as my tools are far from perfect, they're "useful" for people like me that love to save time.

## Issues and crediting
Please, if you have any issue with one of the tools

**DO NOT MESSAGE ME ON DISCORD, OPEN A ISSUE ON GITHUB**

And of course, if you use any of these tools on your mods or anything like that

Please, credit me and the people who in some way, helped on the tool

## Credits
Every tool has their own "Credits" section, so check them out
