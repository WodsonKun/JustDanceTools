# Woody's Just Dance Tools
Public repository created to store my custom-made tools for Just Dance (UbiArt Engine)

## Development and updates
Almost all of the tools were developed by me during boredom on work or something like that

Other tools, like the PictoCooker were adapted from other people's tools (of course, public tools)

I want to update every single tool to become easier to use, and also more efficient, as my tools are far from perfect, they're "useful" for people like me that love to save time.

## Credits
Every tool has their own "Credits" section, so check them out
